This projects consists of two verisons for the Streamlit app.
First one database_individual_project uses the database directly 
Where as the second one individual_project_google_sheets gets the data from a google sheets file
The idea of the app is to answer the business question : "Which diamond cut has the highest average price?" by using two charts - a line chart and a bar chart 
Then when a second button appears that the user has to click to display the answer time.
Then after clicking on the first button again, at the bottom it will appear a Last response time and then when the user presses on the second button again it will display both current and last response time.
